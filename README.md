For compiling the program you need set the following parameters: 
  - Who do you want to play against
  - The board width
  - The board height
  - Who starts
  
## **Two main modes:**

1. Human VS Human
  - after compiling the program, it directly enters you into the game
  - for the first game, the first player( the one with RED token) will start by clicking the RED token andd moving it above the board 
  - when it's released you can see how it drops into the position you want
  - then the second player( the one with BLACK token) will follow the first one by doing the same thing
  - if the board is full then a message will apear with 'Winner: Nobody Tie Click to continue'
  - when one player has 4 tokens in line it will show a message with 'Winner: Human1/Human2 Click to continue'
  - if you want to continue playing the game against a human you will click anywhere on the screen but the one that started the previous match will also start the new one
 
   For you to play against the computer, you have to exit the game and compile the program again with right parameters( computer instead of human)

2. Human Vs Computer
  
  What is done:
   - when compiling the program, it will open a menu where you can choose the level( **easy, medium, hard** )
   - after clicking one level it will redirect you to the game
   - at the moment I have only the interface( which consists of the board, the tokens piles, and the movement of the red token from the red pile )

## **TBD**
 ###### AI for the three levels
 ###### small adjustments to the graphics and code
