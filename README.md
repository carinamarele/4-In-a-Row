For compiling the program you need set the following parameters: 
  - Who do you want to play against
  - The board width
  - The board height
  - Who starts
  
### **Two main modes:**
There are two main modes: H VS H, H VS C.

##I. Human VS Human
  - after compiling the program, a menu will pop out, in which you can type the name of the players if they want.
  - for the first game, the first player( the one with RED token) will start by clicking the RED token and moving it above the board 
  - when it's released you can see how it drops into the position you want
  - for each turn, the names typed in the main menu will appear under their token when their turn is up
  - then the second player( the one with BLACK token) will follow the first one by doing the same thing
  - if the board is full then a message will appear with 'Winner: Nobody IT'S A TIE Click to continue'
  - when one player has connected 4 tokens in line, it will show a message with **Winner: Human1/Human2 Click to continue**
  - if you want to continue playing the game against a human you will click anywhere on the screen but the one that started the previous match will also start the new one
 
   For you to play against the computer, you have to exit the game and compile the program again with right parameters(4th parameter: computer instead of human)

##II. Human Vs Computer
   - after compiling the game, a menu will pop out, where you can choose the difficulty you want to play( **easy, medium, hard**).
   - after clicking one level it will redirect you to the game
   - if the 4th parameter is human, then he starts by clicking and moving the token from the pile above the board and when it's released, it will drop automatically.
   - when it's the computer's turn, the black token will move automatically in its position that the computer decided on.
   - exactly as the other version(H VS H), if someone wins or if it's a tie, a message will pop out (**Winner: Human/Computer Click to continue** , **Winner: Nobody IT'S A TIE Click to continue**)
